 *
 * ONLY FOR A SALE THAT IS RECORDED, and the reason is not tidiness. A picture
 * of a ticket is what a buyer will treat as proof of theirs; sending one before
 * the sale is in the books creates a claim the raffle cannot support at the
 * draw. A ticket that is not recorded sold shows the button DISABLED WITH THE
 * REASON rather than hidden, because an organiser who cannot find the button
 * concludes the app is broken instead of learning that the sale needs
 * recording first.
 *
 * NOTHING NEW IS ASKED OF THE SERVER. Everything this needs — the artwork, the
 * design, the number, the code, the buyer — is already on screen, and the
 * request that fetched it is organiser-only and refused for anybody else. This
 * adds a way to save what is already being looked at; it does not add a way to
 * see more.

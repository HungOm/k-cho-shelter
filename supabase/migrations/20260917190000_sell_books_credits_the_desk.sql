-- The credit rule for a book sold at the desk, which db push could not install.
--
-- b1614f7 changed sell_books so that a book that is NOT out with a seller is
-- credited to whoever is standing at the desk, not to whoever last carried the
-- paper. Returning a book does not clear books.held_by_agent — keeping it is
-- how "brought back by" has a name on it — so the old rule charged ten tickets
-- to a volunteer who had already handed the book back and never took the cash.
-- That is the RM400 across Book-001, 002, 003 and 116.
--
-- That change went into supabase/functions.sql only, and `supabase db push`
-- does not read that file. The newest migration defining sell_books is
-- 20260915233000_integrity_phase1.sql, which still has the old rule. So a
-- project brought up to date with db push alone gets the old credit rule back,
-- silently, and starts making the same mis-attribution again.
--
-- Same class as 20260917170000, found the same way and by the same test:
-- tests/integrity.test.mjs now fails when any function a migration installs
-- differs from the one functions.sql calls canonical.
--
-- THE DROP IS PART OF THE CHANGE, not tidying. p_sold_by is a new parameter and
-- `create or replace` cannot change a signature, so without it the old
-- ten-argument function stays alongside this one and a call naming its
-- arguments is ambiguous between them — "function is not unique", raised at the
-- moment somebody sells a book.
--
-- GENERATED from supabase/functions.sql, verbatim, so the two cannot drift.
-- DATA LOSS RISK: NO. One function is replaced; no row is read or written.
